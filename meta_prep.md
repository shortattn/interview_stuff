**My Journey Preparing for Meta MLE Interview**

Started prepping in Feb—felt overwhelmed like many of you who haven't done much Leetcode or struggle to keep up. Here’s my approach, broken down for those of us with short attention spans:

### Motivation and Study Schedule

-   Woke up early at 6 am to study. Fresh brain, no distractions.
-   Studying at night works too; find what fits your schedule best.
-   Struggled to wake up early initially but pushed through for 2-3 days. Sat facing the sun for 10-15 minutes to reset my circadian rhythm.
-   Bought an Alaskan Northern Lights LED lamp (Aurora Mini) for cloudy days—better than cheaper options. Helps with seasonal depression and boosts motivation.

### Study Content

-   **Neetcode Premium:** Completed basic and advanced DSA courses.
-   **Leetcode Premium:** Did Neetcode 150 by topics, then moved on to Leetcode 150 for more variety.
-   **Company Questions:** Focused on Meta's top 100 questions from the last 90 days, refreshing daily to capture new trends.

### Study Method

-   Watched Neetcode videos (1.5x speed), wrote code while understanding the explanations.
-   After courses, tackled Neetcode 150 with the same method.
-   Midway, reviewed questions done—checked if I could figure out the algo with 15-20 seconds of thinking. If not, repeated similar problems.
-   Focused on weak topics like trees by doing more problems.
-   Kept track of questions, solutions, and notes on [Brainscape](https://www.brainscape.com/p/5VH55-LH-D4T82) <- My flash cards  (or use Excel). Included time and space complexities.
-   Did some non-Meta company questions to avoid over-specializing.
-   Solved 272 questions, repeated many 3-5 times.
-   Reviewed user-submitted solutions for more concise and understandable code.

### Coding Tips

-   Used Python libraries like `itertools`, `functools`, `collections`.
-   Functions: `map`, `reduce`, `zip_longest`, `zip`, `filter`, `starmap`.
-   Practiced custom classes for Heaps and writing the `__lt__` method for advanced use cases.

### Common Interview Topics

-   **Heaps:** (e.g., top k, most frequent k).
-   **Time Intervals:** (e.g., merge intervals, find non-overlapping intervals).
-   **String Replacement:** Handle nested keywords in dictionaries.
-   **Linked Lists & Trees:** (e.g., insert in a circular linked list).
-   **Backtracking & Graphs:** Focus more on backtracking; graphs came up less often.

### Beyond Leetcode: The Hard Stuff

-   **IC3 and IC4 Focus:** More on Leetcode; tough Online Assessments (OA).
-   **IC5+ (Senior+):** Less Leetcode, more project discussions—focus on leadership, influence, and handling challenges.
-   Behavioral and project discussions are key; they want to see you as a leader, not just a coder.

### Behavioral and Project Discussion Tips (IC5+)

-   Prepare at least 4 projects on:
    -   Disagreements and how you resolved them.
    -   Self-driven improvements.
    -   Complex projects involving multiple teams.
    -   Leveraging your expertise to lead impactful projects.
-   Write down bullet points; rehearse like a script.
-   Use ChatGPT to refine and simulate hiring manager scenarios.

### System Design (IC5+)

-   Follow a clear, structured approach; don't just "wing it."
-   Break down steps, discuss pros and cons, and choose one.
-   Use ChatGPT to practice and get feedback.

### Maximizing ChatGPT

-   Refine behavioral responses and system design explanations.
-   Simulate mock interviews based on your resume.
-   Use it to explain difficult Leetcode problems and create pseudocode.

### Time Management Tips

-   Use a timer for Leetcode to avoid hyper-focusing on a single problem.
-   Interview.io is worth the investment for system design mock interviews.

### Investment for Prep

-   **Leetcode:** Essential if you're buying only one resource.
-   **Neetcode Premium:** Highly recommended.
-   **ChatGPT:** Great for refining behavioral and system design prep.
-   **Interview.io:** At least one mock interview.
-   **Tick Time Cube Timer:** Keeps you on track.
-   **Alaska Northern Lights Lamp:** Helps with motivation.
-   **Noise-Canceling Headphones:** Essential for focus, especially if you have distractions.
